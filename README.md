## Why Brown Noise?

Brown noise, characterized by its deeper frequency profile compared to white or pink noise, offers several benefits:

- Enhanced focus and concentration
- Improved sleep quality
- Stress reduction
- Ambient sound masking
- Less fatigue during extended listening

The sound's power spectral density decreases by 6 dB per octave, creating a deeper, richer quality that many find more soothing than other noise colors.
